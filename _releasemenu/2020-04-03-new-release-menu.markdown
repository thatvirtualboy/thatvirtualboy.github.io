# VMware Flings
[VMware Flings](https://flings.vmware.com) are tools built by VMware employees that are intended to be explored, played with, and tested. They are totally free and often expand VMware software capability, or fill functionality gaps. Some Flings eventually become productized into official code like the amazing [vSphere HTML5 Web Client](https://flings.vmware.com/vsphere-html5-web-client) or my own [Horizon Collector for macOS](https://flings.vmware.com/horizon-collector-for-mac). Many flings are also open source!
