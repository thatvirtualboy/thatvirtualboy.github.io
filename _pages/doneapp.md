### Done: Not a todo app
![Meet Done](assets/images/DoneApp/meet.png){:width="60%"}
<br>
<br>
Done is a minimal menu bar app dedicated to tracking your completed tasks. Unlike traditional to-do apps, Done focuses on what you’ve already achieved, helping you keep a clear record of your accomplishments.

Whether you’re tracking tasks related to a work project, indie development, customer initiatives, or personal achievements, Done makes it simple to log your completed work efficiently.

> Traditional to-do apps are all about things you still need to do, and once you do them, the task disappears and is gone from your records. **Done** allows you to log your completed tasks as you go so you can log your data and visualize your accomplishments. 

Key Features:

•	**Unobtrusive and Lightning Quick**: Done lives in your menu bar, providing immediate access to log tasks with a single click.  
•	**Automatic Time Logging**: The time of entry is recorded automatically, with optional time spent tracking.  
•	**Tagging System**: Assign tasks to specific projects or categories using customizable tags.  
•	**Visual Insights**: SwiftUI Charts provide visual representations of your task activity, showcasing distribution, time spent, and tag types over the last 7 days.  
•	**Data Export**: Export your logged tasks as CSV, JSON, or Text files to share with your team or report to your manager.  
• **Shortcuts Support**: Integrate task logging into your workflows with the built-in Siri Shortcuts support.   
• **Apple Reminders Integration**: Sync your completed Apple Reminders tasks
