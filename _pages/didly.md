  <h2>Highlights at a glance</h2>
  <p>Highlights helps you spot patterns in your work with quick, motivating stats.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Peak days:</strong> See which days you pack in the most — and least — activity.</li>
    <li><strong>Top & low focus:</strong> Discover your most and least frequent tags or themes.</li>
    <li><strong>Deep or light effort:</strong> Break down time spent in focused, heavy‑lift work vs. lighter, routine tasks.</li>
    <li><strong>Ignore weekends:</strong> Optionally skip Saturdays and Sundays to keep the focus on your workweek.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Momentum & Focus</h2>
  <p>Didly pairs <strong>Momentum</strong> and <strong>Focus</strong> to nudge healthier work rhythms.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Momentum</strong> reflects consistency over time — streaks, cadence, and days-with-activity. Even small wins count, because progress compounds.</li>
    <li><strong>Focus</strong> captures the mix of effort — from deep, focused work to lighter, maintenance tasks. Both matter. Deep work moves the big rocks; light work keeps the wheels turning.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Together, they help you hack productivity and fuel motivation without the guilt spiral.</p>

<section>
  <h2>Works with Shortcuts</h2>
  <p>Plug Didly into your automations with iOS Shortcuts. Log wins hands‑free with Siri, from widgets, or inside your custom workflows.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Log Task:</strong> Prompt for details and add a complete entry.</li>
    <li><strong>Quick Log:</strong> Capture a fast win with a preset time.</li>
    <li><strong>Log to Work / Log to Personal:</strong> Route tasks to your preferred context.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Example: “Hey Siri, log a 5‑minute task,” or chain Didly actions after a Calendar event ends.</p>
