# Privacy Policy

At rakTech LLC, we believe privacy is a first class citizen. This is why rakTech apps are purpose-built to be private and secure. Our apps never require signs ups and exclusively use integrated Apple-focused technologies like iCloud (where applicable). We believe you should feel safe and confident using our apps.

- **No personal data collection:** None of our apps collect personally identifiable information (things like name, email, or location.)  
- **Anonymous analytics:** Some of our apps may use [TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com) to gather anonymous usage data (like device type, system version, or app interactions). This helps us improve our apps, but it never identifies you personally.  
- **Your control:** Since we don’t collect personal information, there’s nothing for us to sell, share, or misuse. Your data stays yours.  

We design our apps to be enjoyable, respectful, and safe. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at [support@raktech.app](mailto:support@raktech.app).
