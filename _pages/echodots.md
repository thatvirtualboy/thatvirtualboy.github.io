**Unlock the Echo Chamber**: Go from the standard 3 Echos to a whopping 7 free Echos every week.

Newcomers will revel in an immediate boost to 7 Echos for immediate value.

**Color Your Challenges**: Elevate your experience with exclusive game palettes, offering a fresh lens to tackle each sequence.

**Strategize with Numbers**: Enhance your gameplay with a number overlay, allowing you to visualize colors with numbers for a different strategy approach. This feature is perfect for players who find numbers more intuitive, adding an extra layer of strategy.

- Receive 7 Echos each week instead of 3
- Adjust sequence play speed
- Add numbers to your game board
- Choose from 9 exclusive game board color palettes
- Access premium alternate app icons

###### When do Echos get refilled?
Echos refill every Sunday. Players can expect 3 Echos added to their current balance; *Echodots+* players get 7. Gameplay during the week is required to be eligable (i.e., players gotta play!) Additional Echos can be purchased any time.  

###### Do Echos stack?
Yes. Echos can be accumulated through In-App Purchases and weekly refills.  

###### I'm not getting alerts when a new sequence is available
Alerts are triggered at midnight UTC. If you're not seeing alerts when a new daily sequence is available, you may need to enable the **Daily Alert** in app settings. If this is already enabled, try toggling it off and back on again to reset the notification config.

###### Does Echodots require internet access?
Yes. Daily sequences are generated, compared, and validated to the Echodots servers which requires an internet connection.

###### I added a home screen widget but it's blank
This is an iOS issue usually resolved by rebooting your device.

###### I like the game, but the sequence moves to fast for me
The option to adjust sequence playback speed is available with *Echodots+*.

###### Do purchases sync across devices?
Yes. *Echodots+* memberships, including status and perks, can be restored on multiple devices signed into the same iCloud account. Echo balances are also synchronized across devices.

###### Does gameplay sync across devices?
Yes. Gameplay is synced using iCloud so you can start playing the day's sequence on one device, and pick up where you left off on another. You may need to stop the app and relaunch to pull the latest gameplay.

###### What triggers a *Resume Game* status?
As soon as the daily sequence is viewed, the game is considered *in play* and the sequence cannot be viewed again without using an Echo. Once the daily game has been completed with a win or a loss, the status is considered completed until the game resets the next day. Additionally, if a game is started and unfinished before the next sequence is available, that game session is rendered incomplete and your current streak is reset.

###### Can I reset my game?
Yes. In the app, go to Settings > Support > Delete App Data. This will delete all gameplay history including streaks and Echos.

###### Does Echodots support Family Sharing?
Family Sharing is not supported at this time.
