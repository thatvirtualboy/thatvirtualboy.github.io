**Unlock the Echo Chamber**: Go from the standard 3 Echos to a whopping 7 free Echos every week. Whether you're just starting out or you're a seasoned player, these additional Echos promise more gameplay, more strategies, and more victories. Newcomers will revel in an immediate boost to 7 Echos for immediate value.  

**Master Your Momentum**: Gameplay too sluggish or too speedy? With the ability to tweak the sequence play speed from a deliberate 0.2x to a blistering 3x, you control the rhythm of your game. This means every session is tailored to your preference, making your victories always within reach.   

**Color Your Challenges**: Elevate your experience with exclusive game palettes, offering a fresh lens to tackle each sequence. Choose from a selection that includes calming Earth tones, the soothing Blues, the warm Reds, or the glowing Neon among others. Each palette not only changes the game's appearance but also brings a new mood and strategy to your play.  

**Strategize with Numbers**: Enhance your gameplay with a number overlay, allowing you to visualize colors with numbers for a different strategy approach. This feature is perfect for players who find numbers more intuitive, adding an extra layer of strategy.  

**Visualize with Sybmols**: Elevate your experience with a symbol overlay, enabling you to visualize colors through SF Symbols for a visual strategic approach. This feature is ideal for players who find symbols more intuitive, adding an additional dimension of strategy. Symbols randomize upon toggling.

**Personalize Your Home Screen**: Your game, your icon. With premium alternate app icons, choose from distinctive designs to reflect your style right on your home screen. Whether you're drawn to the sleekness of Dark, the unassuming Grays, or the inclusivity of Miniature, your app icon can be as personal as your gameplay.

<div class="faq-item">
    <h6 class="faq-question">How do Streaks work?</h6>
    <p class="faq-answer">
        Your *Streak* is how many daily games in a row you've won. If you lose a game, or miss a day of playing, your current Streak gets reset. As your Streak grows, you'll see your Max Streak grow with it. The Max Streak is what's publishd to Game Center Leaderboards so you can compete with friends, or with global users.
    </p>
</div>


<div class="faq-item">
    <h6 class="faq-question">When do Echos get refilled?</h6>
    <p class="faq-answer">
        Echos refill every Sunday. Gameplay during the week is required to be eligible (i.e., players gotta play!) Additional Echos can be purchased any time.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
    <h6 class="faq-question">Can Echos be stacked?</h6>
    <p class="faq-answer">
       Yes, with conditions! Weekly Echo refills do not accumulate, but any additional Echos purchased through IAPs will add to your existing balance.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
    <h6 class="faq-question">I'm not getting alerts when a new sequence is available</h6>
    <p class="faq-answer">
        Alerts are triggered at midnight UTC. If you're not seeing alerts when a new daily sequence is available, you may need to enable the <strong>Daily Alert</strong> in app settings. If this is already enabled, try toggling it off and back on again to reset the notification config.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
    <h6 class="faq-question">Does Echodots require internet access?</h6>
    <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. Daily sequences are generated, compared, and validated to the Echodots servers which requires an internet connection.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
    <h6 class="faq-question">I added a home screen widget but it's blank</h6>
    <p class="faq-answer">
        This is an iOS issue usually resolved by rebooting your device.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
    <h6 class="faq-question">I like the game, but the sequence moves too fast for me</h6>
    <p class="faq-answer">
        The option to adjust sequence playback speed is available with <em>Echodots+</em>.

</div>

<div class="faq-item">
    <h6 class="faq-question">Does gameplay sync across devices?</h6>
    <p class="faq-answer">
        Yes. Gameplay is synced using iCloud so you can start playing the day's sequence on one device, and pick up where you left off on another. You may need to stop the app and relaunch to pull the latest gameplay.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
    <h6 class="faq-question">What triggers a <em>Resume Game</em> status?</h6>
    <p class="faq-answer">
        As soon as the daily sequence is viewed, the game is considered <em>in play</em> and the sequence cannot be viewed again without using an Echo. Once the daily game has been completed with a win or a loss, the status is considered completed until the game resets the next day. Additionally, if a game is started and unfinished before the next sequence is available, that game session is rendered incomplete and your current streak is reset.
    </p>
