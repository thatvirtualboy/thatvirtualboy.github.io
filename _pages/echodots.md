**Unlock the Echo Chamber**: Go from the standard 3 echos to a whopping 7 free echos every week. Whether you're just starting out or you're a seasoned player, these additional echos promise more gameplay, more strategies, and more victories. Newcomers will revel in an immediate boost to 7 echos for immediate value.  

**Master Your Momentum**: Gameplay too sluggish or too speedy? With the ability to tweak the sequence play speed from a deliberate 0.2x to a blistering 3x, you control the rhythm of your game. This means every session is tailored to your preference, making your victories always within reach.   

**Color Your Challenges**: Elevate your experience with exclusive game palettes, offering a fresh lens to tackle each sequence. Choose from a selection that includes calming Earth tones, the soothing Blues, the warm Reds, or the glowing Neon among others. Each palette not only changes the game's appearance but also brings a new mood and strategy to your play.  

**Strategize with Numbers**: Enhance your gameplay with a number overlay, allowing you to visualize colors with numbers for a different strategy approach. This feature is perfect for players who find numbers more intuitive, adding an extra layer of strategy.  

**Personalize Your Home Screen**: Your game, your icon. With premium alternate app icons, choose from distinctive designs to reflect your style right on your home screen. Whether you're drawn to the sleekness of Dark, the unassuming Grays, or the inclusivity of Miniature, your app icon can be as personal as your gameplay.
