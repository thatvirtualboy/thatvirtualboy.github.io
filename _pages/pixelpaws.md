#### A pixel pet app for kids (and kids at heart)
**Pre Orders Coming Soon**  

---

Introducing the cutest new app for your Apple Watch -- **Pixel Paws** brings back the joy of classic digital pets, now on your wrist*.

**Made for kids, trusted by parents**  
No ads. No tracking. No in-app purchases or subscriptions. Just safe and meaningful moments of fun.

**Care, Play, Earn**  
From breakfast to bedtime, your little pixel friend depends on you. Play with them, walk them, and repeat. Each action works on a **cooldown timer** throughout the day.  

When the timer completes, they're ready for attention again. It’s the perfect balance of fun and freedom, with gentle reminders to check in (configurable).

**Play More, Earn More**  
Every time you care for your Pixel Paw friend — whether it’s feeding, walking, or playtime — you earn coins. These coins are used to unlock new **pets**, playful **backgrounds**, and fun **weather scenes**.

It’s all part of the experience — **no ads** and **no in-app purchases**. Just delightful play that rewards consistency, care, and creativity.

**Coin Boost**  
Earn double the coins for a limited time when you unlock new pets or scenes, letting you refill your coin bank even faster. Plus, your boost durations stack when you unlock multiple items!

#### About the developer
Hi, I’m Ryan! I made Pixel Paws because my kids wanted a fun pet game on their Apple Watches – kind of like a modern Tamagotchi. They just wanted to play with pets and unlock new ones, while I needed something safe, private, and no hidden in-app purchases. So, I built Pixel Paws – a simple game with a big heart, perfect for kids and anyone who loves a little retro pet fun. Thanks for checking it out! ❤️
