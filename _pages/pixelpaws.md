#### About the developer
Hi I'm Ryan üëã I made Pixel Paws for a real simple reason: I bought my kids Apple Watches and they really wanted an app to care for a pet on their wrist -- Tamagotchi-style. After browsing the App Store it became clear there was nothing that met *both* my kids' criteria, and mine as a parent. 

They wanted a simple game where they could play with pets and unlock new ones. I wanted something private, safe, and low-cost -- with no ads, tracking, or pressure.

So I built Pixel Paws ‚Äî a tiny game with a big heart. It's made with kids in mind, but great for anyone who loves Gigapet-style games. If you're looking for something sweet, safe, and a little bit silly, you may just love Pixel Paws!

Thanks for checking it out ‚ù§Ô∏è
