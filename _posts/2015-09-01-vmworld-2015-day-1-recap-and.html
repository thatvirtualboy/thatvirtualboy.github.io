<blockquote>HUGE thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/dougdavis22" target="_blank">Doug Davis</a>, Senior Technical Account Manager with VMware for compiling the data!</blockquote><br/><strong>Photon Platform</strong> - Introducing the Photon Platform: Purpose-Built for Running Cloud-Native Applications<br/><br/>For DevOps and software as a service (SaaS) organizations, running cloud-native applications at scale requires a container-optimized platform developed for high churn workloads and an API-first model. VMware will today demonstrate the VMware Photon Platform, which is purpose-built to meet this emerging need and features "just the right level of functionality" to run cloud-native applications at scale. Showcased as a technology preview, the VMware Photon Platform is designed for DevOps teams planning to build out large pools of commodity computing capacity that solely run cloud-native applications. DevOps teams will have a choice of open container orchestration frameworks including Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, Mesos and Cloud Foundry to run on the platform. The technology -- components of which will be open sourced -- will also support dynamic continuous integration environments, platform as a service (PaaS) or SaaS deployments, and sizable data analytics clusters running Hadoop or Spark.<br/><br/>The VMware Photon Platform, which will include future integrations with VMware NSX, VMware Virtual SAN and VMware vRealize Suite, features the following technologies:<br/><p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>VMware Photon Controller</strong> - A multi-tenant, API-driven control plane optimized for scale, churn and high-availability. Automation-savvy DevOps teams will be able to speed the creation of thousands of new containers per minute and support hundreds of thousands of total simultaneous workloads. The controller will be released as an open source project to help encourage broad input, testing and adoption from customers, partners and the community at large. The technology will also incorporate Project Lightwave, which provides enterprise-grade trust and security for containers.</p><br/><p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>VMware Photon Machine</strong> - This technology will include a new ESX Microvisor based on the proven core of VMware ESXi. It also includes Project Photon OS, a lightweight Linux operating system for containerized applications and optimized for VMware environments.</p><br/><strong>VMware vCloud Air Disaster Recovery Services:</strong><br/><p style="padding-left:30px;"><strong>Disaster Recovery OnDemand™: </strong>VMware will add a pay-for-what-you-consume pricing option to VMware vCloud Air Disaster Recovery.
