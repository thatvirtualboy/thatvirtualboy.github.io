With the release of Workspace Portal 2.1, the vApp has been reduced to a single VM providing simpler deployment and administration. [See my post <a href="http://thatvirtualboy.blogspot.com/2014/09/whats-new-in-vmware-workspace-portal-21.html" target="_blank">What's New in Workspace Portal 2.1</a>] This also means it's extremely easy to run inside of VMware Workstation or Fusion. In this post, we'll be covering how to import Workspace Portal 2.1 into VMware Workstation.<br/><blockquote class="tr_bq">Why would you want to run Workspace Portal in a desktop solution like Workstation?</blockquote><br/><div><br/><br/>Well it's by no means a production solution. It does provide a decent lab environment at best though! This is great for tinkering with the product before implementing in a vSphere environment. You can get a pretty good idea for how the product flows. If you happen to have a more advanced home lab setup in Workstation already (With Active Directory, vCenter Server, etc). If you don't, luckily there is a <b>Demo User Store</b> that can be selected during the Web GUI configuration which will create dummy accounts for you and use an embedded OpenLDAP instance on the VM. Pretty cool!<br/><br/>More info on using the <a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/workspace-portal-21/topic/com.vmware.wsp-install_21/GUID-EC1D2CD7-67F1-49C5-8208-FA69AE97E4C0.html" target="_blank">Demo User Store here</a><br/><div></div><br/><div><b>To install Workspace Portal 2.1 in Workstation:</b></div><br/><div><br/><ol><br/>	<li>Download the Workspace Portal 2.1 OVA</li><br/>	<li>In Workstation, choose <b>File</b> &gt; <b>Open</b></li><br/>	<li>Configure your desired Name and Location, and choose <b>Import</b></li><br/>	<li>Review the details of the VM<a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;text-align:center;" href="https://thatvirtualboy.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/23502-screenshot2bfrom2b2014-11-182b073a363a14.png"><img src="https://thatvirtualboy.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/23502-screenshot2bfrom2b2014-11-182b073a363a14.png" alt="" width="320" height="194" border="0" /></a><br/><b><br/></b></li><br/>	<li>Power on the VM, and you'll run through the <b>Setup Wizard</b><br/><ol><br/>	<li>Choose [1] for a complete installation</li><br/>	<li>Enter [y] to accept</li><br/>	<li>Next configure your hostname, DNS, and IP settings</li><br/>	<li>When done, hit [q] to continue, then [y] to confirm</li><br/></ol><br/></li><br/>	<li>After it performs its initial boot and configuration, you'll see the familiar Login screen with an IP address.<a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;text-align:center;" href="https://thatvirtualboy.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/058a9-screenshot2bfrom2b2014-11-182b073a443a27.png"><img src="https://thatvirtualboy.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/058a9-screenshot2bfrom2b2014-11-182b073a443a27.png" alt="" width="320" height="179" border="0" /></a><br/><br/>NOTE: in this example, we're using a Bridged network connection. This can be verified and configured under <b>VM</b> &gt; <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>Network Adapter</b></li><br/>	<li>In my setup, I want to be able to access Workspace with the hostname I provided earlier in the setup. In order to do that, I need to modify my computer's /etc/hosts file. My daily OS is Linux Mint, so I will perform this via the command line:<br/><ol><br/>	<li>First ensure you can ping the appliance from the IP listed in the console window<br/><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;">ping 192.168.3.161</span></li><br/>	<li>Then add an entry for the appliance in the hosts file<br/><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;">vi /etc/hosts</span>The entry should follow this format:<br/><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;"> FQDN shortname</span><br/><br/>e.g., <span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;">192.168.3.161 workspace21.mycomputer.local workspace21</span></li><br/></ol><br/></li><br/>	<li><span style="font-family:inherit;">Once your hosts file is updated, you should be able to ping the appliance by the name you gave it.</span></li><br/>	<li><span style="font-family:inherit;"><span style="font-family:inherit;">Final step is to open a browser and login per the console window's instructions!<br/></span></span><br/><div style="text-align:left;"></div></li><br/></ol><br/><div>Next Steps: Run through the web GUI to further configure the appliance.
