NSX.. EVO:RAIL.. Virtual SAN.. ever wish you could have a simple one-stop-shop for learning about the latest virtualization technologies? A place to answer the questions of "Why does this exist" and "How can this help me" or "If I were interested, what would this cost me?"<br/><br/>Enter Product Walkthroughs.<br/><br/><a href="https://featurewalkthrough.vmware.com" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-867" src="https://thatvirtualboy.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/screen-shot-2015-12-28-at-7-27-29-am.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-12-28 at 7.27.29 AM" width="665" height="113" /></a><br/><br/>VMware's <a href="https://featurewalkthrough.vmware.com" target="_blank">Product Walkthroughs site</a> is a publicly available resource for answering those questions. The best part is the site not only covers basic product overview, but it drills down into feature sets too. Try utilizing the Search bar or browse the Trending topics to see additional topics like understanding vROPs Forecasting Capacity, or Restoring a virtual machine with vSphere Data Protection, or learning more about the ESXi Firewall.<br/><br/>Remember to share with your friends! Enjoy!
