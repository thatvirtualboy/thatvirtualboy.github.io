## Where to start
There have been plenty (PLENTY) of posts covering what's new in vSphere 7, so we're not going to review that. Instead I think it would be helpful to consolidate a lot of the chatter and content out there into a single location. VMware has posted several of these types of blogs as well in the spirit of being able to relive the announcements and flow of content.

If you're looking to catch up, start by checking out this awesome compilation page: [http://vmw.re/vsphere7](http://vmw.re/vsphere7).
