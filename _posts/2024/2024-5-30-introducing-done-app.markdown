I needed an app for work that allowed me to easily track tasks I've completed to share up the chain. Almost like the opposite of a to-do app... a to-done app? 

I wanted something with a focused use case instead of just keeping a list of notes, so I came up with **Done** -- a minimalist menu bar app dedicated to tracking completed tasks. Unlike traditional to-do apps, Done focuses on what I've already achieved, helping me keep a clear record of my accomplishments. It can even sync completed tasks from Apple Reminders. Then I can export the data to a .csv and share as needed. Maybe there's someone out there looking for something similar.

>Whether you’re tracking tasks related to a work project, indie development, customer initiatives, consulting gigs, or personal achievements, *Done* makes it simple to log your completed work efficiently.
