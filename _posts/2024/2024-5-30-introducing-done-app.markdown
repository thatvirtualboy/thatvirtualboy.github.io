**Done** is a minimal menu bar app dedicated to tracking your completed tasks. Unlike traditional to-do apps, Done focuses on what you’ve already achieved, helping you keep a clear record of your accomplishments.

Whether you’re tracking tasks related to a work project, indie development, customer initiatives, consulting gigs, or personal achievements, *Done* makes it simple to log your completed work efficiently.
