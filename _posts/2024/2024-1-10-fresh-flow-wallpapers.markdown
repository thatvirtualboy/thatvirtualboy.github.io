Only a week ago I shared my wallpaper collection, [The Grid](https://thatvirtualboy.com/new-years-wallpapers/), welcoming 2024 and sharing a brief message of hope as we look to the new year ahead. I think it's safe to say I'm enjoying all too much creating and sharing these wallpapers with you, and am so very grateful for your support and words of encouragement. I can't say this will continue to be a *weekly* occurence, but I'm excited to share a fresh collection with you today.  

Some of my favorites graphic designs depict multiple colors melding together in harmony. Apple's recent default wallpapers in iOS 17 and macOS Sonoma are some great examples of that type of artwork. Largely inspired by those pieces, this  `Fresh Flow`  collection is defintely a more vibrant turn of inspiration than *The Grid*. I hope it helps brighten up your screens and your days ðŸ˜Š.
