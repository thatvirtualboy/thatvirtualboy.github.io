I’m excited to introduce my latest project, Echodots! It’s a daily pattern game where your memory is put to the test. Each day, a new 5-digit global sequence is displayed on the game board and you have 5 chances to repeat it back in the correct order. Track your streaks, share with friends, and go for the win! 

> Who is this game for?

This game is great for players of all ages who enjoy daily challenge games. Once you’ve completed the daily challenge, you’re off the hook until tomorrow! If you’ve ever played games like Wordle, or Simon Says, you’ll love Echodots! It’s even been built with the visually impaired in mind to be more accessible for all people.*

> What’s different about Echodots?

When the daily sequence plays, it plays only once. To win the daily challenge, repeat the sequence in the order you saw it. Players are awarded Echos which allow the daily sequence to be replayed. But be careful! Echos are a precious commodity in Echodots. Eligible players get their echos refilled every Sunday.

> Wait.. what makes a player *eligible* for Echo refills? 

Players who return to the game throughout the week are eligible for weekly refills. Simply by playing the game, you’re good to go! As a bonus, *Echodots+* players get even more refills each week.

> Echodots+ ?!? What is that?

*Echodots+* allows players to go beyond the basics of the gameplay and customize the game to their liking. From adjusting the sequence play speed, to more game board palettes, to number overlays and symbol overlays, Echodots+ is the best way to ensure victory is within reach every day.

> Cool, but it’s probably a subscription, right?

Wrong! Echodots is free to download and *Echodots+* is available as a small one-time purchase. The game also has no annoying ad banners or popups. My hope is that this creates a delightful experience for everyone.

> Where can I get it?

Echodots is available exclusively on the App Store. The best experience is on iPhone, although it’s also available for iPad, Mac (designed for iPad), and Apple Vision Pro (designed for iPad).
