Spring is right around the corner. With Apple [introducing a fresh Spring collection](https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/04/here-are-the-new-iphone-case-and-apple-watch-band-colors-for-spring/) of iPhone Cases and Apple Watch bands, it's the perfect time to also freshen up our wallpapers!

Inspired by the vibrant and festive color palette of Big Sur, **Spring Dream** adds a massive dose of brightness and joy to your homescreen. Testing the waters with this one on social media proved it was well liked, so I'm happy to share it with you today. It's also a fun one to manipulate as it looks great flipped in every direction. 

#### Pro tip: blurring the top
Notice the difference in application between this simulated frame, and a real device:

![Real Device](/assets/images/SpringDream/real.png){:width="50%"}  

The real device applied a beautiful *blur* to the top, and you can do this too with a quick trick: When applying the wallpaper, simply pinch the image a bit before saving, and you'll notice iOS magically renders a blur effect to the top of the image. I've highlighted this behavior in this video:

<video width="560" height="315" controls>
  <source src="/assets/images/SpringDream/spring_wallpaper.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

And of course, we have to blur the wallpaper for the homescreen ðŸ˜Š

Please enjoy *Spring Dream*, and have a wonderful Spring!
