Today I'm thrilled to share some exciting updates related to my macOS menu bar app, now rebranded as **Did•It**

#### What is Did•It?
*Did•It* (formerly *Done*) is a lightweight yet indepsensible macOS menu bar app desigend to help track tasks you've already completed. Unlike traditional to-do lists, *Did•It* focuses on creating an archive of tasks you've accomplished. Whether you're tracking what you've done related to a work project, indie development, customer initiatives, or personal achievements, *Did•It* makes it simple to log and review your completed work.  

Users love its simplicity and configurable options like completed Apple Reminders sync, default time assignment, and task entry reminders. Whether they bulk-add tasks from recent memory using the menu bar drop down, or they automatically sync their completed tasks from Apple Reminders, users find that *Did•It* is the easiest way to record and review their work. It's the *"not a todo app"* that shows you just how much you've accomplished.

#### A New Name for a Refined Purpose
*Done* is now *`Did•It`*. This rebrand represents more than just an incremental update — it captures the essence of what the app is all about: easily capturing your accomplishments and giving you a simple, elegant way to track what you’ve achieved. With this change, *Did•It* stands out in the market, reflecting its unique focus and purpose. 

#### Free for Everyone
In a significant shift, *Did•It* is now **available as a free download** for all macOS users. Previously offered as a one-time purchase, this update removes any barriers to entry, ensuring everyone can benefit from easily tracking their completed tasks and accomplishments.

While *Did•It* is free, it remains entirely *ad-free* and *subscription-free* — no strings attached. For those who find the app valuable, an optional “Buy Me a Coffee” link is available, providing a simple way to support its development and show appreciation.

#### What's Next?
These updates mark the beginning of a new chapter for *Did•It*. Build `2024.11` will be available on the Mac App Store soon and includes improved CSV export, rebranded assets, and will be free for everyone. I’m committed to continuing its evolution and ensuring it remains an indispensable tool for its users.

[Download **Did•It**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/done-not-a-to-do-app/id6503087781?mt=12) today and start keeping track of your daily accomplishments.
