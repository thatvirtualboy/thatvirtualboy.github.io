The WWDC24 Keynote was jam packed with announcements and updates to all of Apple's major operating systems, including visionOS, macOS, iOS, watchOS, and iPadOS. The keynote even covered updates to the Audio & Home platforms, as well as introduced [Apple Intelligence](https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/), the all new AI-driven platform supercharging the ecosystem's next-gen capability. 

As expected, Apple featured their iconic bento assets summarizing each category as they closed out a topic. For your viewing pleasure, I've captured and included each bento image below in the order of their appearance. 

One amusing tidbit: notice the text for visionOS casts a shadow providing depth (spacial awareness?), as opposed to the rest of the bentos which feature the traditional flat text.
