One of my favorite wallpapers of all time is this one below, titled simply *Hope.* I discovered it years ago as one of the included wallpapers in an old Linux Mint distro. I used to run Linux Mint as my daily operating system for several years, circa 2012-2014.

*`Wallpaper Source: Linux Mint`*

Although I haven't used Linux Mint in quite some time, this wallpaper has stuck with me through and through. I've always ensured it was safely stored in whatever backup solution I relied on at the time so that I could bring it with me to new computers and platforms. Time and time again I've found myself coming back to this wallpaper, finding that it brought calm to my chaos, peace to my pains, and decorum to my disorder.

This wallpaper has always inspired me toward simplicity. The way the fades are minimal and the tones are deep yet muted. It supports content on a screen rather than detracts or distracts from it.

#### Hope Refreshed
I had the thought to create something inspired by this provoking wallpaper. After all, it's helped inspire so much for me throughout the years. I chose to create something of a *sequel* to Hope. A piece that is modern and refreshing, yet still captures the elegant simplicity the original eminates. 

I came up with **Hope Refreshed** and am thrilled to share it with you. With Hope Refreshed, you'll find a familar blend of smooth transitons, a more vibrant color palette and, optimisitcally, a similar sense of inspired simplicity.
