I'm happy to share a small but useful update to Wall Genie allowing all users to more easily download the app's most recent *free* community wallpaper.

As you know, *every 7th community wallpaper* in Wall Genie is **free to download** for all users - no strings attached. Free downloads are clearly marked as such, and live alongside the rest of the community content. 

#### Shortcuts
![Shortcut](/assets/images/WallGenie/shortcut.jpeg){:width="50%"}  
As of Wall Genie 1.4, a new Shortcut action is available allowing all users to quickly save the most recent free image to their Photo Library. This shortcut is integrated with Siri, so you you can simply ask to save the most recent free wallpaper, and voila. 

You can also customize the action in Shortcuts to use a different phrase, or configure it to fit into your own workflows. Perhaps you have an automation that runs every Sunday evening, and you could include this shortcut to download a fresh wallpaper right to your Photos. It's up to you!

Here's a video showing the new shortcut in action:

#### Feedback
So what do you think? Let me know how you're using this shortcut and I'd love to share it across the socials. 

What other shortcuts would you like to see in Wall Genie? Let me know in the comments or hit me up on social. Thanks and enjoy the update!
