Millions gathered in unity this week to catch a glimpse of the total solar eclipse passing over North America. From [posting iPhone pictures through solar glasses](https://x.com/iMore/status/1777408060694188311), to Apple-inspired walls from [Basic Apple Guy](https://basicappleguy.com/haberdashery/totalsolareclipse), everyone seemed to participate in the event one way or another.

Exploring the theme of layered objects, I created these images to capture a sense of continuity eminating from a central source. In an endless pursuit of minimalist themes and cool blues to grace my devices (I'm learning I have a type...), I thought I'd share these wallpapers I'm calling *Blue Eclipse*. Please enjoy!
