On Monday May 13th, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman *live tweeted* OpenAI's event where [GPT-4o](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/) was announced. Call me old fashioned, but I was happy to see a silicon valley Tech CEO with nearly 3 million followers reference *live tweeting* as opposed to whatever the uppers at **X.com** want it called. 

Live X'ing?   
Live Posting?  

There's simply nothing that has the same ring to it.
