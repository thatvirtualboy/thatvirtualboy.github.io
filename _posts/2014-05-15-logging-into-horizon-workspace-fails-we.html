This error can be pesky as it is a bit misleading. The full error will read something similar to<br/><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="background-color:white;color:#434343;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, 'Bitstream Vera Sans';font-size:12px;">We were unable to authenticate you. Please check your credentials and try again.</span></blockquote><br/>Furthermore, you may notice whenever you load the Workspace login page a notice at the top that reads<br/><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="background-color:white;color:#434343;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, 'Bitstream Vera Sans';font-size:12px;">Identity provider's url scheme mismatches with that of the request. This could happen when the request is received on https and the Identity provider's is running on http.</span></blockquote><br/>This behavior is usually caused by our IdP trying to use port 443 but SSL authentication is disabled. To resolve this issue:<br/><ol><br/>	<li>Login to the <b>connector-va</b> web page</li><br/>	<li>Click on <b>Identity Providers</b></li><br/>	<li>Verify the IdP hostname is correct and using port 443</li><br/>	<li>Check the box to <b>Use SSL for end-user authentication</b></li><br/>	<li>Click <b>Save</b></li><br/></ol><br/><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"></div><br/><div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;" href="https://thatvirtualboy.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/85d2e-idp_ssl.png"><img src="https://thatvirtualboy.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/85d2e-idp_ssl.png" alt="" width="400" height="261" border="0" /></a></div><br/><div><b> </b></div><br/><div><b> </b></div><br/><div>Give that user's login another go and you should be on your way.</div>
