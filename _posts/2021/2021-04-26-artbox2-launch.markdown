The wait is finally over -- Artbox 2 is live on the App Store!

The *must-have* app for parents is free (for a limited time) on the App Store for iPhone and iPad. An Apple Exclusive, Artbox 2 takes the value and simplicity of Artbox Classic to new heights with an all-new app built from the ground up.  
Check out the landing page at [https://artbox.app](https://artbox.app)

### What is Artbox?
Artbox is an app designed to help you minimize clutter by storing digital records of your kids' artwork.

Artbox 2 has the same features you love from Artbox Classic like a private profiles for each artist, auto-calculation of the child's age at the time of the project, and shareable entries. I'm excited to introduce even more features and capabilities including

• iCloud Backup / Sync  
• iPad support  
• Widget Support  
• Expanded Language Support (Spanish, Dutch, French, and Chinese at launch)  

With Artbox 2 being built natively in Apple's new SwiftUI, longevity of support and enhancements will be much easier to maintain.

### What makes Artbox different?
I'm proud to make Artbox 2 available with

• No subscription costs  
• No hidden In-App Purchases (available IAPs are for an optional Tip Jar only)  
• No In-App Advertisements  

If you enjoy the app, please consider leaving a review on the App Store or sharing it with a friend.
