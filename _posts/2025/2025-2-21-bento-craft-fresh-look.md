Introducing the new `Bento|Craft` icon — a refined visual that embodies the essence of its creative workspace.

Inspired by the recently released *Canvas* design tool, the icon zooms in on the core element of all bentos: the box. It overlays the signature grid workspace, and features a beautiful blue gradient fill. Most notably, it features the iconic blue dot handle, a staple of `Bento|Craft’s` new intuitive interaction model.

This refreshed icon represents precision, flexibility, and creativity, just like the tools inside `Bento|Craft`. It’s a nod to the way you manipulate, resize, and craft with ease.
