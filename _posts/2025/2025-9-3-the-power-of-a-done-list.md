At the end of the day, it‚Äôs easy to focus on what didn‚Äôt get finished. That unchecked to-do list can make you feel like you‚Äôre falling behind, even if you got a lot done. That‚Äôs where a **‚Äúdone list‚Äù** comes in. Instead of tracking what you *should* do, it keeps track of what you *actually did.*  

Turns out, there‚Äôs plenty of research showing this simple shift can improve focus, reduce stress, and even help you move forward in your career.

### Why Done Lists Work  

- **They calm the brain**  
  Checking something off gives your brain a sense of completion. That little ‚ÄúI did it‚Äù moment matters‚Äîstudies show it reduces anxiety and helps you regain a sense of control ([Self.com](https://www.self.com/story/done-lists?utm_source=thatvirtualboy.com)).  

- **They make progress visible**  
  During stressful times, a traditional to-do list can feel like a never-ending reminder of what‚Äôs left. A done list flips the perspective‚Äîyou can see proof of what you‚Äôve already accomplished, even if it‚Äôs something small ([Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/productivity-got-done-list?utm_source=thatvirtualboy.com)).  

- **They build momentum**  
  Productivity experts point out that done lists create a feedback loop. Each recorded win‚Äîbig or small‚Äîreinforces progress and makes it easier to tackle the next thing ([Inc.com](https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/how-emotionally-intelligent-people-use-done-list-to-feel-more-productive-fulfilled-accomplished.html?utm_source=thatvirtualboy.com)).  

- **They help with reflection**  
  Looking back on what you‚Äôve accomplished is motivating in itself. Chris Bailey, author of *The Productivity Project,* suggests reviewing your done list at the end of each week to spark ideas and focus for the next one ([ChrisBailey.com](https://chrisbailey.com/keep-a-weekly-accomplishments-list/?utm_source=thatvirtualboy.com)).  


### Why Not Just Stick With To-Dos?  

To-do lists aren‚Äôt the enemy‚Äîthey‚Äôre useful for structure, prioritizing, and reducing mental clutter. The problem is when they‚Äôre the *only* system. They show you what‚Äôs left, not what‚Äôs working. Pairing a to-do list with a done list gives you the full picture: what needs attention *and* proof of progress.  

### How Didly Fits In
