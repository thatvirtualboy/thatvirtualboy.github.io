I will document the upgrade process of my 7.0.0 lab in a separate post, including the Linux Desktops (which haven't been updated since the unmanaged process from Horizon 6) from unmanaged to managed desktops.<br/><br/><a href="http://bit.ly/2cqTG56" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;&gt; Release Notes &lt;&lt;&lt;</a><br/><a href="http://bit.ly/2cR6psZ" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;&gt; Downloads &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/></a><a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/euc/2016/09/vmware-horizon-7-0-2-horizon-client-4-2-now-ga.html" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;&gt; Official Announcement &lt;&lt;&lt;</a><br/><h3></h3><br/><h3>Horizon 7.0.2 Fixes</h3><br/><ul><br/>	<li>View Administrator displays the error "Unable to query the replication state of the server" regarding the replication status of a Connection Server machine. This problem is a display issue that occurs with non-EN language Connection Server machines.</li><br/>	<li>The error message "No valid certificates were found on this smart card" appears on the Horizon Client for Windows, when you use a PIV smart card to authenticate to Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012 R2 and above desktops that do not have middleware installed. This problem is resolved when you install Horizon Agent 7.0.2 in the remote desktops and enable Windows auto update to let Windows install the PIV smart card minidriver on both the Windows client and Horizon agent.</li><br/>	<li>An error message appears when you run an executable (.exe) file that requires the administrator privilege from a network share folder on a physical workstation or virtual machine that has VMware View Persona Management version 6.2 installed.</li><br/>	<li>The Horizon Administrator Web page shows a page cannot be displayed error if you install View Connection Server 7.0.1 with the FIPS mode enabled on any drive other than the C drive.</li><br/>	<li>Windows 10 desktops that have Horizon 7.0 installed with View Persona Manager and some applications crash with a Blue Screen of Death.</li><br/>	<li>Windows Media MMR does not work on Windows 10 desktops.</li><br/>	<li>View Composer performs unsealed LDAP searches.</li><br/>	<li>In Horizon Administrator, when you add an instant-clone domain administrator and then create an instant-clone desktop pool, some virtual machines in the instant-clone desktop pool might fail to clone.</li><br/>	<li>In a Microsoft Network Load Balancer environment, an authentication error occurs when you use VMware Identity Manager to launch a remote desktop.</li><br/></ul><br/><h3>Horizon 7.0.2 New Features</h3><br/><ul><br/>	<li><strong>VMware Blast policy </strong><br/>View administrators can configure the H.264 Quality Blast policy settings to specify the image quality for the remote display configured to use H.264 encoding.</li><br/>	<li><strong>Client Drive Redirection </strong><br/>For Horizon Client 4.2 or Horizon 7 version 7.0.2 or later, if VMware Blast Extreme is enabled, files and folders are transferred across a virtual channel with encryption.</li><br/>	<li><strong>Global data collected by VMware </strong><br/>If you join the customer experience improvement program, VMware collects data aboutTrue SSO for the View environment.</li><br/>	<li><strong>Restrict remote desktop access outside the network </strong><br/>View administrators can allow access to specific entitled users and groups from an external network while restricting access to other entitled users and groups.</li><br/>	<li><strong>Smart Cards for multiple user accounts </strong><br/>In some environments, a user's smart card certificate can map to multiple Active Directory domain user accounts. A user might have multiple accounts with administrator privileges and needs to specify which account to use in the Username hint field during smart card login. To make the Username hint field appear on the Horizon Client login dialog box, the administrator must enable the smart card user name hints feature for the Connection Server instance in View Administrator. The smart card user can then enter a user name or UPN in the Username hint field during smart card login.</li><br/>	<li><strong>Remote desktop operating systems </strong><br/>The following remote desktop operating systems are supported:<br/><ul><br/>	<li>Windows 10 64-bit and 32-bit Enterprise and Professional; Build 1511</li><br/>	<li>Windows 10 64-bit and 32-bit Enterprise Long Term Service Branch (LTSB); Fresh installation only; Build 1507</li><br/>	<li>Windows 10 64-bit and 32-bit Anniversary Update; Fresh installation only; Tech preview only; Build 1607. Upgrade is not supported.</li><br/></ul><br/></li><br/>	<li><strong>Windows Media Multimedia Redirection (MMR) operating systems </strong><br/>The following Windows MMR operating systems are supported:<br/><ul><br/>	<li>Windows 10</li><br/>	<li>Windows Server 2016 is a tech preview feature</li><br/></ul><br/></li><br/>	<li><strong>Windows registry keys for Flash Redirection </strong><br/>View administrators can set requireIECompatibility=true to enable Flash Redirection for Web sites that support HTML5 by default. This parameter is not required for the YouTube Web site. In certain situations, setting appMode=0 can improve performance, and setting appMode=1 can result in a better user experience.</li><br/>	<li><strong>Horizon 7 for Linux desktops enhancements</strong><br/><ul><br/>	<li>Automated full-clone desktop pool</li><br/>	<li>SSO for SLED 11 SP3 and SP4</li><br/>	<li>Horizon Client 4.2.0 for Android</li><br/></ul><br/></li><br/></ul><br/>&nbsp;<br/><br/>&nbsp;
