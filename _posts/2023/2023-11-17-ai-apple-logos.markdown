In playing around with AI Image Generation, I ended up down a rabbit hole of creating Apple-themed logos. I couldn't help but think they would make great wallpapers across my devices. And of course, I wanted to share.

These images were generated through the use of several prompts and I was quite pleased with how they turned out. I then upscaled them and remastered them a touch to create the final products for Mac, iPad, and iPhone wallpapers. I wouldn't consider them groundbreaking in any way, but am more than happy to share with anyone who would appreciate them.

Enjoy!
