Hello There's Winter Update and App Store event is live! Not only is Hello There the best way to capture and organize all the Christmas cards you receive this year, but it's also great for sending quick and easy ecards. For the 2023 Holiday season, I'm excited to introduce the all new **Holiday Wonder E-Post Collection** 

**Hello There+** users automatically gain access to this new collection available in the 2023.12 update, [available now](https://apple.co/3TWTeey). Paired with a thoughtful text, these e-post cards are an easy and lightweight way brighten someone's day.
