Available today, `Bento|Craft` now supports alternate icons! This update comes in part by request of several users, but also as a way for me to offer more choice for you to customize your bento experience. 

In the *Alternate Icons* page you'll find 21 icons, separated into **Icon Packs**. Included with your download is the **Launch Edition Pack** and the **Community Pack**. The Launch Edition Pack is my way of saying *Thank You* to everyone who has downloaded & shared `Bento|Craft` ðŸ«¶. The Community Pack is something I hope to see grow with submissions from passionate designers and iOS Developers alike. More about that below! 

The remaining Icon Packs are available for purchase at `$1.99` each (50 cents per icon). As of this writing, the packs include  

**Variant One Pack**  
**Blues Pack**  
**Neon Pack**  
**Gradient Pack**

When you select an alternate icon, you'll notice the new design brilliantly displayed on the main Settings page as well as on your home screen. All purchases are non-consumable so you can restore your purchases if you get a new device or re-install the app.

#### Community Pack
If you're interested in submitting an icon for consideration, please email a `1024x1024` PNG of your design (no rounded corners) to [support@raktech.app](mailto:support@raktech.app). Accepted submissions will gain a dedicated spot in the Community Pack with a link to your website/socials. A major shoutout to Walter Wunderlich for being the trailblazer for this exciting Icon Pack! You can see more of his work on [his Mastodon account](https://mstdn.social/@gestalter).
