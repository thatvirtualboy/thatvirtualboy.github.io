It's happened to all of us - we go to find a particular desktop in the View Inventory only to find it's not there. You didn't delete, so who did?<br/><br/>Luckily we know better than to survey our co-workers - we can confirm from the logs!<br/><br/>On the Connection Server, navigate to <i>C:\ProgramData\VMware\VDM\logs</i> and check out the DEBUG logs.<br/><br/>Typically you will see a line similar to:<br/><br/><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;">2014-09-11T10:45:18.210-07:00 DEBUG (0B1C-0B47) [ws_TomcatService] STDOUT: 2014-08-11 10:45:18 [com.vmware.vdi.desktopcontroller.PendingOperation]-[DEBUG] Pool floating::Stopping &amp; deleting VM /EUC/vm/Floating/Win7-01.</span><br/><br/>In this example, if you trace the session ID (0B1C-0B47), you'll also find a line earlier in the log such as:<br/><br/><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;">2014-08-11T10:39:23.053-07:00 DEBUG (0B1C-0B38) [ws_TomcatService] STDOUT: 2014-09-11 10:39:23 [com.vmware.vdi.admin.ui.LoginBean]-[INFO] User ryan has successfully authenticated to View Administrator</span><br/><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br/></span><span style="font-family:inherit;">And voila! User ryan has been busted.</span>
