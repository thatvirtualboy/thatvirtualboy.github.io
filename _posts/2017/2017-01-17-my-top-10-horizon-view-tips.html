If you're just getting started with managing a Horizon View environment, or&nbsp;if you're&nbsp;looking for ways to make the most of your new environment, then head on over to the&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/services-education-insights/2017/01/top-10-tips-successful-horizon-vdi.html" target="_blank">VMware TAM Blog</a>&nbsp;to see my Top 10 List for a successful Horizon View deployment. This post covers the basics for the core Horizon Infrastructure, so no mention of app virtualization or profile management. Those may come later if there's enough demand.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/services-education-insights/2017/01/top-10-tips-successful-horizon-vdi.html" target="_blank"><img alt="https://blogs.vmware.com/services-education-insights/2017/01/top-10-tips-successful-horizon-vdi.html" border="0" data-original-height="1161" data-original-width="1600" height="464" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IQ4T0YKco2U/Wgtzd6ftVdI/AAAAAAAAvy0/XYFJDoHissYqB1nDPgGhpG3ODJTYttEdQCLcBGAs/s640/horizon_7-port-diagram.png" width="640" /></a></div>
