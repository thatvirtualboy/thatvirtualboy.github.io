Everyone here is energetic and excited to get the conference started. The 110 degree weather here in Las Vegas only made the drinks and apps better at the welcome reception. Mini-Grilled cheese anyone? How about a Greek Salad Shooter? <br /><br />The registration and merch lines were almost non-existent (I guess it pays to land right as the welcome reception is starting!). After running into some fun faces like Ray O'Ferrell (CTO), Jack McMichael (EUC SE), and Brian Davidson (PREM Sr. Mgr), I got to mingle with some TAM customers and discuss the SDDC Journey they're on.  <br /><br />VMware's booth (at the very back of Solution's Exchange) has an amazing setup with demos and experts to talk about VMware vision and to dig into the technical details of our solutions. Other than beer sleeves, the hand out of choice this year appears to be none other than the fidget spinner.  <br /><br />Tomorrow's General Session with Pat Gelsinger should be great. See you there!
