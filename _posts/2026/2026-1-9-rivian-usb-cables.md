If you’re using Rivian’s Headrest Device Mounts for backseat entertainment, you’re going to need a cable that not only matches the aesthetics of the Rivian interior, but one that's as rugged as your truck.

After trying a few different options, I landed on what I think is the *perfect* cable for this setup: the  
**[chubbycable FlexElbow 90 Degree 240W Fast Charging Cable](https://amzn.to/3LjStgj)**.

#### Why This Cable Works So Well in a Rivian

This cable checks three big boxes for me: **aesthetics, durability, and length**.

---

#### 1. It Matches the California Dune Interior 👌

Let’s start with the obvious: **it looks fantastic in the R1T**.

The yellow accent color on the FlexElbow cable pairs incredibly well with the subtle yellow interior accents in the California Dune R1T. Makes things look much more intentional, which is nice in these premium cabins.

Although I opted for yellow, really all the colors they offer look really good.

#### 2. Built Like a Tank (Seriously)

This is one of the most solid-feeling USB-C cables I’ve ever used.

- Thick, braided exterior  
- Reinforced strain relief  
- Firm but flexible construction  
- **90-degree elbow connector** that takes stress off the port

That elbow design is especially clutch when devices are mounted on the headrest. No awkward bending, no torque on the device, and no fear of the connector getting bumped or snapped when kids climb in and out.

#### 3. The 0.82ft Length Is *Perfect* for Headrest Mounts

At **0.82 feet**, the cable is:
- Long enough to comfortably reach mounted devices  
- Short enough to avoid dangling loops or cable clutter  
- Ideal for **iPads, Kindles, and Nintendo Switches** on Rivian Headrest Device Mounts  

No excess cable to tuck away. It looks good.

#### Bonus: Overkill Charging Specs (In a Good Way)

The FlexElbow supports **up to 240W fast charging**, which is obviously more than you’ll ever need for tablets or handhelds — but that also means it’s future-proof.  

I’m a big fan of accessories that are *under-stressed* in daily use.

### Final Thoughts

If you’re setting up rear-seat entertainment in your Rivian and want something that:
- Looks like it belongs
- Holds up to real-world use
- Keeps your setup clean and clutter-free

The **[chubbycable FlexElbow 90 Degree 240W USB-C Cable](https://amzn.to/3LjStgj)** is an easy recommendation — especially in the **0.82ft length**.

It’s one of those small upgrades that quietly makes the whole experience better.

If you’ve found other interior add-ons that level-up your cabin experience, I’d love to hear about it 👇
