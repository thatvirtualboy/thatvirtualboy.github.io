<p>Artbox 2 has the same features you love from Artbox Classic like a private profiles for each artist, auto-calculation of the child’s age at the time of the project, and shareable entries. I’m excited to introduce even more features and capabilities including</p>

<p>• iCloud Backup / Sync<br />
• iPad support<br />
• Widget Support<br />
• Expanded Language Support (Spanish, Dutch, French, and Chinese)</p>

<p>With Artbox 2 being built natively in Apple’s new SwiftUI, longevity of support and enhancements will be much easier to maintain.</p>
