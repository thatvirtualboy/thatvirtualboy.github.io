I"u<p>Our oldest daughter turned 8 this month and is at a great age to start keeping an allowance for completing chores around the house. One challenge my wife and I faced right away is the fact that we donâ€™t keep much cash on hand. We rarely visit banks, and most of our financial dealings are done electronically, making it difficult to pony up when allowance is due.</p>
