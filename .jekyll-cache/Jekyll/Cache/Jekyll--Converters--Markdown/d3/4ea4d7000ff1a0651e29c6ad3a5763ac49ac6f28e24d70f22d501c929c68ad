I"'<p>They say all good things must come to an end. But in the world of software, it’s usually because there’s something newer and better to replace it!</p>

<p>A part of any IT Administrator’s job is to track the lifecycle of the products deployed in their infrastructure. This can be a daunting task for any sizable environment. Luckily VMware makes it easy to keep tabs on such important dates with the <a href="https://lifecycle.vmware.com/#/">Product Lifecycle Matrix</a></p>

<p>Be sure to bookmark this useful page and reference it often. You could even go as far as to put the EOGS dates into your calendar with a reminder set of a healthy lead time to give you the proper runway for planning, testing, and implementing an upgrade.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in what product versions are approaching end of general support for the 2022 calendar year, I’ve generated a document (using the matrix linked above) of every product. Brace yourself, as it’s a large list! Each of these product builds will be entering into the <a href="https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/lifecycle.html"><em>Technical Guidance Phase</em></a> of their product lifecycle sometime this year.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
