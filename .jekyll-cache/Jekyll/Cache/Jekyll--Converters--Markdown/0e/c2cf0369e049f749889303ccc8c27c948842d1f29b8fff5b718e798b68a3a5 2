<p>Whether you’re running Horizon Workspace 1.5 as a POC, or you restricted it to have internal access by design, admins who deployed Workspace without internet access can rejoice knowing that version 1.8 introduces a method for performing an “offline” upgrade. This option was not previously available when upgrading from 1.0 to 1.5.<br /><br />The process includes setting up a local web server and using the <span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;">updatelocal.hzn checkurl</span> command against the web server.<br /><br />When going through the upgrade guide, you may be wondering where you actually get the mentioned <i>updaterepo.zip</i> files. It’s not clearly stated, however, you will need to contact VMware GSS Support in order to obtain those update bits.<br /><br /><a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/horizon-workspace-18/topic/com.vmware.ICbase/PDF/horizon-workspace-18-upgrade.pdf">http://pubs.vmware.com/horizon-workspace-18/topic/com.vmware.ICbase/PDF/horizon-workspace-18-upgrade.pdf</a></p>
