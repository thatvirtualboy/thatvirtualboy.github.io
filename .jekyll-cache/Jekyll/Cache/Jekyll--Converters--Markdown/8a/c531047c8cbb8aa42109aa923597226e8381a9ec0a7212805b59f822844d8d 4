<p>Artbox 2 has the same features you love from Artbox Classic like a private profiles for each artist, auto-calculation of the childâ€™s age at the time of the project, and shareable entries. Iâ€™m excited to introduce even more features and capabilities including</p>

<p>â€¢ iCloud Backup / Sync<br />
â€¢ iPad support<br />
â€¢ Widget Support<br />
â€¢Â Expanded Language Support (Spanish, Dutch, French, and Chinese at launch)</p>
