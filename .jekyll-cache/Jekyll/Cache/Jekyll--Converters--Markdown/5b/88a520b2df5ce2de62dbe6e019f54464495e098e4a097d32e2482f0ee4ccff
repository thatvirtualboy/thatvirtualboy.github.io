I"á<p>At WWDC21, Apple introduced a new capability to developers called <em>In-App Events</em> which are timely events within your apps and games such as a <strong>game competition</strong>, a <strong>fitness challenge</strong>, a <strong>movie premier</strong>, and more.</p>

<p>These events are discoverable right in the App Store in whatâ€™s called an <em>Event Card</em>. The Event Card shows details like the event name, a short description, and a time indicator. These event cards can be static images, or videos highlighting the contents of the event. Event cards are displayed on your Appâ€™s product page, and can also show up in the App Storeâ€™s search results.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One interesting tidbit about the placement of Event Cards.. users who have already downloaded your app will see the events <strong>above</strong> the screenshots in your product page. Users who have not downloaded your app will see them <strong>below</strong> the app screenshots.</p>
