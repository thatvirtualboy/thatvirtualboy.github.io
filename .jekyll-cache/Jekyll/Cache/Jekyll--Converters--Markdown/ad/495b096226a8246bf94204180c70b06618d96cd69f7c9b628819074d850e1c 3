I"å<p>In developing <em>Artbox 2</em>, one thing I set out to accomplish was making the user experience more immersive and personable. One of the ways to achieve this is to add <em>haptic feedback</em>. Haptics are the vibration responses to the user interacting with the application. When youâ€™re buying something with Apple Pay, scrolling through a picker, or receiving confirmations and alerts - haptics are widely used in mobile apps and can greatly enhance the user experience.</p>
