Several years ago I <a href="https://flings.vmware.com/horizon-ova-for-ubuntu">published a VMware Fling</a> called <strong>Ubuntu OVA for Horizon</strong>. At that time, Linux in Horizon was still fairly new and not particularly popular. With the recent <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet">Windows 7 EOL</a> and complications of <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/euc/2017/10/10-best-practices-windows-10-migration.html">managing Windows 10</a>, many organizations are finding themselves interested in providing <em>Linux</em> as a Virtual Desktop. Additionally, I’m seeing rising interest in providing Linux environments to developers as Kubernetes is taking off and IT administrators are looking for ways to manage developer access to resources.</p>

<h4 id="update-version-12-of-the-ubuntu-ova-for-horizon-is-now-available-vmware-flings">~UPDATE~ <strong>Version 1.2 of the Ubuntu OVA for Horizon is now available: <a href="https://flings.vmware.com/horizon-ova-for-ubuntu">VMware Flings</a></strong></h4>

<p>Horizon 7 for Linux Desktops is an excellent solution, and one that’s gaining popularity. As many Horizon Admins are historically more skilled in Windows Administration rather than Linux, I wanted to make something that helped ease the learning curve and get admins off the ground right from the beginning.</p>

  <p>Enter the Ubuntu OVA for Horizon!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m happy to announce version 1.2 of this Fling which brings support for the latest VMware Horizon 7 builds and uses an Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS base image.</p>

<p>Keep an eye, subscribe, follow my Twitter…the new VMware Horizon Ubuntu OVA will be available soon!</p>
