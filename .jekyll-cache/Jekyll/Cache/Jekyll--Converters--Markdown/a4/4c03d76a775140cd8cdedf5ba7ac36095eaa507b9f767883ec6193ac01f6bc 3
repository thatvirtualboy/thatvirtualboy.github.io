I"ü<p>VMware, not unlike most IT companies, offers <a href="https://www.vmware.com/support/services/overview">multiple tiers of support</a>. Two of which fall under the umbrella of Premier Services. These are the highest tiers available and are currently broken into what‚Äôs known as Business Critical Support and Mission Critical Support.<br /><br />Both offerings are all about the ‚Äúwhite-glove‚Äù treatment. But which one is right for you? Let‚Äôs break it down:<br /><br /><a href="https://thatvirtualboy.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/compare.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-712" src="https://thatvirtualboy.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/compare.png?w=660" alt="compare" width="660" height="247" /></a><br />&lt;h4&gt;Business Critical Support (BCS)&lt;/h4&gt;<br /><em>Personalized support delivered by a designated team</em><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Add-on to Production Support</span> - this means BCS cannot exist without a valid Production Support Agreement. Generally speaking, these times will usually compliment one another so that you aren‚Äôt left without a current support agreement - but it‚Äôs certainly something to be aware of!<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Designated Senior TSE for 6 Customer Contacts</span> - ¬†Each BCS customer is assigned a Senior Technical Support Engineer. This engineer is their dedicated point of contact into the Support Organization and is responsible for holding regular cadence meetings with the 6 Support Administrators (customer contacts entitled for BCS).<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Technical Relationship</span> - Your dedicated TSE is considered an extension of your IT team. With regular meetings in place and a deep knowledge of your VMware Infrastructure, your assigned TSE builds a invaluable rapport with the designated Support Administrators.<br />&lt;h4&gt;Mission Critical Support (MCS)&lt;/h4&gt;<br /><em>Priority access to senior-level engineers and proactive account management</em><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Add-on to Production Support</span>¬†-¬†Same situation as BCS above.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Designated Account Manager</span> - MCS¬†requires TAM services and many MCS customers utilize an MCS TAM that helps drive support success, as well as drive projects and regular environment reviews.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Senior TSE Team Routing for Unlimited Customer Contacts</span> - The 6 ‚ÄúSupport Administrator‚Äù limitation (like with BCS) is gone and an unlimited amount of contacts are entitled to MCS support.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Enhanced SR and Phone Response</span>¬†- All other support offerings have a Severity 1, 2, 3, and 4 level for SRs with response times of 30 min, 4 hours, 8 hours, and 12 hours, respectively. MCS, however, has 30 min, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 8 hour response times, respectively.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Onsite Support</span> - In extreme situations when the customer would benefit from an onsite support presence, MCS will offer to send one if its Senior Resources who specializes in the subject matter at hand to help drive the current challenges to resolution.<br /><br />All in all, VMware Premier Service‚Äôs goal is to ensure the customer is nothing but delighted with the level of support they‚Äôre paying for.
