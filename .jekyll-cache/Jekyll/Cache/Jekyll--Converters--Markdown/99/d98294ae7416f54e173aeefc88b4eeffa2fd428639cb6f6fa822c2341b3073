I"©<p>Iâ€™m very excited to announce that Virtual Backgrounds app is now available on macOS as a Mac Catalyst app! ðŸ¥³</p>

<p>Virtual Backgrounds was my first ever app built for iOS. It started out as an experiment as I was learning app development last year during quarantine. Itâ€™s certainly a simple app from an architecture standpoint, but the proof of concept was successful and the app itself has proven to be mildly successful on the App Store.</p>

<p>Version 3.0 of the app was rebuilt from the ground up in native SwiftUI which has really been a fun adventure. Part of the capability this opened up for the app is being able to port it from iPadOS to macOS with relatively little effort. Now, a single download of the Virtual Backgrounds app gives you access to it on you iPhone, iPad, and Mac!</p>

An app featuring hand-picked virtual backgrounds to be used with your video conferencing tool (e.g., Zoom).</p>
