<h2 id="where-to-start">Where to start</h2>
<p>There have been plenty (PLENTY) of posts covering whatâ€™s new in vSphere 7, so weâ€™re not going to review that. Instead I think it would be helpful to consolidate a lot of the chatter and content out there into a single location. VMware has posted several of these types of blogs as well in the spirit of being able to relive the announcements and flow of content.</p>
