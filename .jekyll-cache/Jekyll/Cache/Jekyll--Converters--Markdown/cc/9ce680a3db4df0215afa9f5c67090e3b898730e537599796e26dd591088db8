I"/<p>In developing Artbox 2, one thing I really wanted was the ability to make the user experience more immersive and personable. One of the ways to achieve this is to add haptic feedback. Haptics are the vibration responses to the user interacting with the application which can greatly enhance the overall experience. When you’re buying something with Apple Pay, scrolling through a picker, or receiving confirmations and alerts - haptics are widely used in mobile apps. You can read more about haptics at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/haptics/">Apple’s Developer Docs here</a>.</p>

<p>SwiftUI, Apple’s newest coding language, includes certain haptics by default. The most notable example being the <strong>Toggle</strong>. These toggles are found all over the iPhone’s Settings app. Notice when you enable or disable a toggle, there’s a discrete vibration that gives you the sensation of really interacting with the software. You likely have even noticed variations of these haptics throughout iOS and across different applications and scenarios. These are due to the custom Sharpness and Intensity</p>

<h3 id="adding-haptics-to-your-app">Adding Haptics to your app</h3>
<p>Adding haptics into your SwiftUI is really very easy and is certainly a way to add polish to your app.</p>

<p>By simply declaring the <code class="highlighter-rouge">UINotificationFeedbackGenerator</code> in your Views, you can call multiple types of haptic alerts.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">let haptic = UINotificationFeedbackGenerator()</code></p>

<p>Now let’s say you want to have a custom, subtle vibration occur when an error is triggered in your app. Simply add the below line to your action:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">self.haptic.notificationOccurred(.error)</code></p>

<p>Here’s a full example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td class="rouge-code"><pre>if userText == ""  {
    print("Error - Text cannot be blank")
    isErrorPresented = true
    self.haptic.notificationOccurred(.error)
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">.error</code> is built into the <code class="highlighter-rouge">UINotificationFeedbackGenerator</code> class so it does not need to be defined manually.</p>

<p>There are more options in addition to <code class="highlighter-rouge">.error</code> such as<br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">.warning</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">.success</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">.light</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">.medium</code><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">.heavy</code></p>

<p>Apple’s Documentation warns against over-doing haptics, so you’ll want to use them sparingly. Take time to explore your app’s interface and apply haptics where it makes the most sense.</p>
