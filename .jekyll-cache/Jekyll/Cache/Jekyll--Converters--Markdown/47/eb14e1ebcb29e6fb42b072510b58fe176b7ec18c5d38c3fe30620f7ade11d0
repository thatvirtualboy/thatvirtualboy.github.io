I"Ÿ<p>My greeting card organizer app for iOS, <strong>Hello There</strong>, has been updated to version 1.2. This new version introduces the ability to purchase a hand-written letter and have it mailed on your behalf to anywhere in the world. Iâ€™m calling this new service <strong>Hello There Post.</strong></p>

<p>This new features is made possible by using Apple Pay and Stripe to process payments for physical goods.</p>

<p>There are a small handful of apps that allow you to purchase cards and have them sent in the mail, but none (that Iâ€™ve found so far) offer for the letter to be hand-written for that extra personal touch.</p>

<p>With version 1.2, there are 2 types of cards that can be purchased:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Thank you card</li>
  <li>Blank any-occasion card (Black or White variant available)</li>
</ol>

<p>All cards are high quality paper and are shipped within 3 business days of purchase. I think this puts the app in a unique space as a major greeting card handler for both saving and sending. I canâ€™t wait for you to give it a spin!</p>

<p>Check it out on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hello-there-greeting-cards/id1632485298">App Store</a></p>
