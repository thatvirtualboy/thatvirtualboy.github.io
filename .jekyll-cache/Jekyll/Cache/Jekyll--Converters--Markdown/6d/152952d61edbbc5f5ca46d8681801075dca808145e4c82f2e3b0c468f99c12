I"6<p>My greeting card organizer app for iOS, <strong>Hello There</strong>, has been updated to version 1.2. This new version introduces the ability to purchase a hand-written letter and have it mailed on your behalf to anywhere in the world. Iâ€™m calling this new service <strong>Hello There Post.</strong></p>
