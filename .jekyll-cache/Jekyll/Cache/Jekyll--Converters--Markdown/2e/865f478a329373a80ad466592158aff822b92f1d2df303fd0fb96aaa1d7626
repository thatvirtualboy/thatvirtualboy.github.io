I"‰<p>In developing Artbox 2, one thing I really wanted was the ability to make the user experience more immersive and personable. One of the ways to achieve this is to add haptic feedback. Haptics are the vibration responses to the user interacting with the application which can greatly enhance the overall experience. When youâ€™re buying something with Apple Pay, scrolling through a picker, or receiving confirmations and alerts - haptics are widely used in mobile apps. You can read more about haptics at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/haptics/">Appleâ€™s Developer Docs here</a>.</p>
