I"ž<p>In developing Artbox 2, one thing I really wanted was the ability to make the user experience more immersive and personable. One of the ways to achieve this is to add haptic feedback. Haptics are the vibration responses to the user interacting with the application which can greatly enhance the overall experience. When youâ€™re buying something with Apple Pay, scrolling through a picker, or receiving confirmations and alerts - haptics are widely used in mobile apps. You can read more about haptics at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/haptics/">Appleâ€™s Developer Docs here</a>.</p>

<p>SwiftUI, Appleâ€™s newest coding language, includes certain haptics by default. The most notable example being the <strong>Toggle</strong>. These toggles are found all over the iPhoneâ€™s Settings app. Notice when you enable or disable a toggle, thereâ€™s a discrete vibration that gives you the sensation of really interacting with the software.</p>

<p>Adding haptics into your SwiftUI is really very easy and is certainly a way to polish things up.</p>

<p>By simply declaring the <code class="highlighter-rouge">UINotificationFeedbackGenerator</code> in your Views, you can call multiple types of haptic alerts.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">let generator = UINotificationFeedbackGenerator()</code></p>
