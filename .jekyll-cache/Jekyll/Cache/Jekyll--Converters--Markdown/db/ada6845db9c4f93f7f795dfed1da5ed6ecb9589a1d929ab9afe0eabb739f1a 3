For example, you could have joe-user first authenticate with an RSA token, and then require joe-user to enter his password after providing the RSA token. If successful, joe-user has double-verfied his identity and can now access Identity Manager, or his entitled application.<br /><br />The cool thing is you can still have authentication fallback configured so that if joe-user fails to authenticate with the configured authentication chain, there can be a fallback authentication method (let’s say RADIUS) to give poor joe-user one last chance.<br />&lt;blockquote&gt;Where is this configured?&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />As you might have guessed, this is configured in the <strong>Access Policies</strong> section of the <strong>Identity &amp; Access Management</strong> tab in the Admin Portal. You can simply Edit the <span style="color:#800000;">default_access_policy_set</span> to include the auth chain, or configure a new policy altogether.<br /><br />For more info on Identity Manager 2.4.1, check out the <a href="https://pubs.vmware.com/Release_Notes/en/vidm_onPremise/24/vidm_release_notes_241.html" target="_blank">Release Notes here</a>.
