I"6<p>VMware has just released Horizon 7.12 which is kind of a big deal! Packed with new features and fixes, this release is timely amid a massive increase in the <strong>Work From Home</strong> movement in attempt to <em>flatten the curve</em> of the COVID-19 spread. This release comes alongside publication of additional methods to securely connecting to your office‚Äôs physical workstations from your home. Let‚Äôs take a closer look.</p>

<h2 id="supporting-the-work-from-home-movement">Supporting the Work From Home Movement</h2>
<p>First and foremost, if you‚Äôre still evaluating how to support your remote workers in this WFM movement, be sure to check out the VMware Webinar from today, March 17th, entitled <strong>Pandemic Preparedness and Response: How to Quickly Set Up a Remote Workforce for Success</strong>. <a href="https://www.vmware.com/learn/458214_REG.html?src=AMEROrganicSocial_SocialAdvocacy&amp;src=so_5a314d05e49f5&amp;cid=70134000001SkJn">You can register here to view the session</a>.</p>

<p>VMware‚Äôs own Graeme Gordon, Senior Staff EUC Architect, published an article today: <a href="https://techzone.vmware.com/resource/using-horizon-7-access-physical-windows-machines#_Toc35336889">Using Horizon 7 to Access Physical Windows Machines Overview</a> covering the steps and tools required to meet this need in times of natural disasters, emergencies, and public health outbreaks.</p>

<p>Additionally, one method to provide a Cloud-based Virtual Desktop Infrastructure is to take advantage of VMware‚Äôs <a href="https://www.vmware.com/horizon-cloud-on-microsoft-azure-trial.html">free 45-day trial of Horizon Cloud on Azure</a>.</p>

<h2 id="horizon-712-whats-new-">Horizon 7.12 What‚Äôs New üöÄ</h2>
<p><strong>ViewAPI now supports pulling Agent Logs</strong>
Horizon 7.10 had introduced the ability to pull Connection Server logs via this method primarily for use with VMware Skyline, but it can be used independently which will be useful for scripting log pulls to attach to open support requests, or otherwise independent troubleshooting. Horizon 7.12 has expanded this ability to the Agent Logs as well.
NOTE: that both options require the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Collection Operation Logs</code> privilege to be assigned to the service account being used in the API call.</p>

<p><strong>RESTful APIs for Configuration are here</strong>
New with this release are REST APIs related to <em>monitoring and configuration</em> of a Horizon environment. This will allow you to build scalable automation frameworks and integrate 3rd party products seamlessly across Horizon View Clusters and Pods. Check out https://code.vmware.com/apis/919 for more details.</p>

<p><strong>Assign multiple users to a single Full Clone Desktop</strong>
Acting as a sort of alternative to a Floating Pool, users can now allow <strong>dedicated machines</strong> to be shared. This capability can come in handy for numerous situations, including shift work, QA and Dev-test groups, or groups with multiple devs/programmers sharing an environment.</p>

<p><strong>Display Assigned Machine Name</strong>
Enabling this feature will show the hostname of the assigned VM instead of the Pool‚Äôs display name in the Horizon Client. If you‚Äôre connecting to a floating pool without assignment, then it will show ‚Äúdisplay-name (No machine assigned).‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Persistent MAC address for RDS and Instant Clones on Refresh and Resync</strong>
Certain applications rely on persistent mac addresses (though this is less of an issue than in times past). New with 7.12 is the ability to enable persistent MAC address which will carry the MAC from the older VM to the new one when following the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">resync</code> workflow.</p>
