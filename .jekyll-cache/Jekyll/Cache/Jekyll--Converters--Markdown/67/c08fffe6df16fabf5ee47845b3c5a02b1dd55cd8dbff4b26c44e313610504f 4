Several years ago I <a href="https://flings.vmware.com/horizon-ova-for-ubuntu">published a VMware Fling</a> called <strong>Ubuntu OVA for Horizon</strong>. At that time, Linux in Horizon was still fairly new and not particularly popular. With the recent <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet">Windows 7 EOL</a> and complications of <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/euc/2017/10/10-best-practices-windows-10-migration.html">managing Windows 10</a>, many organizations are finding themselves interested in providing <em>Linux</em> as a Virtual Desktop. Additionally, Iâ€™m seeing rising interest in providing Linux environments to developers as Kubernetes is taking off and IT administrators are looking for ways to manage developer access to resources.</p>
