I"Y<p>I’m excited to share what I’ve been working on the last several weeks. Recently I posted over on my Github a new project I’m working called Horizon Linux VM. It’s a pre-packaged Ubuntu OVA that automates most of the customization and configuration needed for a Linux Desktop Template to be used in a VMware Horizon 7 environment.</p>
