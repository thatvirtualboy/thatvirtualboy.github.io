I"<p>This week Apple announced the M3 series of chips at their <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Scary Fast event.</a> Like many others, I was amazed when Apple flexed at the end with the statement ‚ÄúThis event was shot on iPhone, and edited on Mac‚Äù. Check out the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/behind-the-scenes-at-scary-fast-apples-keynote-event-shot-on-iphone/"><em>Behind the scenes</em></a> on filming the event  - it‚Äôs really impressive!</p>

<p>During the event, Apple heavily contrasted Apple Silicon with Intel-based Macs (no surprise), repeatedly addressing <em>‚Äúthose who have not yet upgraded from Intel‚Ä¶‚Äù</em></p>

<p>The event was riddled with statements like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Äúa monster upgrade for anyone still on an Intel based Macbook Pro‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Äú11x Faster than fastest Intel-based Macbook Pro‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-predicament">The Predicament</h3>
<p>Many Mac users today still utilize Windows 10 and Windows 11 by way of <em>virtualization</em>, namely using software like <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html">VMware Fusion</a> or other OS virtualizing platforms. For years, the x86 architecture has been the standard that eased users to switching to Mac, since they could easily run their proprietary Windows applications in a window.</p>

<p>But what happens when you restore that Time Machine backup and launch your x86 Windows VM on a M-series Mac?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThis virtual machine cannot be powered on because it requires the X86 machine architecture, which is incompatible with this Arm machine architecture host.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply put: you‚Äôre stuck. Your options are either to stay on your Intel-based Mac, or rebuild your Windows VM from scratch using Windows 11 Arm (and even that may not work!)</p>

<h4 id="windows-11-arm">Windows 11 Arm</h4>
<p>Luckily, VMware <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/2023/10/fusion-13-5-is-live.html">released Fusion 13.5 in October 2023</a> allowing users to run Windows 11 Arm edition which does work on M-series Macs. In fact it works <em>really</em> well.</p>

<p>So why is there a predicament?</p>

<p>Because X86 apps <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/apps-on-arm-x86-emulation">run under emulation</a> on Windows 11 Arm and therefore are not guaranteed to work. I‚Äôve witnessed apps that run fine with Windows 10/11 on Intel based systems fail to properly register critical DLLs, crippling the app‚Äôs functionality. In these scenarios, users are forced to keep their Intel-based configurations around until the app developers update their software to be compatible with Arm.</p>

<p>If you think you could potentially be at risk, it‚Äôs easy to test on an M-series system. Fusion 13.5 can be downloaded as a free trial, and then you can download and install Windows 11 Arm to a fresh VM right from the GUI, giving you ample time to test your proof of concept.</p>

<h3 id="psa">PSA</h3>
<p>The reason I chose to write this article is essentially to serve as a simple public service announcement:</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre an Intel-based Mac user today that relies on Windows virtualization for your productivity, be cautions swapping out your current setup before fully testing your Windows-based apps on Windows 11 Arm. You may very well find yourself having to return that hot new Mac. And that would be pretty scary.</p>
