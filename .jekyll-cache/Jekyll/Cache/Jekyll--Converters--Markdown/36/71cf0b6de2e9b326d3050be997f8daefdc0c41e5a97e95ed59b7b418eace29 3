I"§<p>My blog has gone through a major uplift! When I first started That Virtual Boy, I hosted the blog on Google Blogger. After a few years I migrated to Wordpress because all great blogs are on Wordpress right? üßê After realizing Wordpress was not the place for me, I migrated back to Blogger. But since I don‚Äôt use any other Google services (nope‚Ä¶ none) I didn‚Äôt like the idea of still having to directly rely on Google services. Plus.. I had ads on my blog to try and rack up a buck or two, but guess what? I hate ads! And so do you! So why go through the effort of ensuring my blog forces users to ensure their ad blocker is up to date? I just didn‚Äôt like it.</p>
