These designs provide standardized and streamlined architectures for each deployment scenario and broad use-case, for example: Datacenter Foundation, Single-region &amp; Dual-region IT Automation, QE / Demo Cloud and more. These designs are being made available to you via customer facing documentation, VMware Professional Services (PSO) delivery kits and certified partner architectures.<br /><br />So why spend the time and investment in this type of initiative when we already have reference architectures and whitepapers for each product release? While these assets are a great resource; they typically take into account only that product and that version. The VMware Validated Design process takes into account the entire SDDC stack ensuring product version compatibility, continued testing with product releases, upgrade testing and validation to ensure what you deploy today can be upgraded to the next version. In other words the VMware Validated Design:<br />&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;<strong>Is Designed by Experts, Used by You </strong>&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;Each design for a specific deployment scenario has been created by a team of VMware experts. The design has been improved based on live feedback from customers like you.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;<strong>Is Continuously Validated </strong>&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;Each design is continuously validated by VMware through automated testing. To ensure that once a design has been validated, it stays valid, every new build of any component of the design drops into an automated deployment of the design.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;<strong>Is a Comprehensive Design </strong>&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;Each Design includes everything needed for a fully functional SDDC covering a set of use cases ‚Äì yet remains hardware-agnostic. VMware Validated Designs create reference architectures, deployment walkthroughs, deployment guides, operations guides‚Ä¶and more.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;<strong>Results in Quicker Time to Value </strong>&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;With a quicker deployment of your SDDC you will ensure faster fulfillment of your business needs.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;<strong>Instills Confidence in your SDDC </strong>&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;Build your SDDC using a design validated by experts‚Äîincluding recommended Day 0, Day 1, and Day 2 / ongoing operations. This helps reduce the errors in deploying and operating your SDDC.&lt;/p&gt;<br />Today we are announcing a number of resources being made available to you, our customer. These include two reference architectures and two sets of deployment walkthroughs. The first reference architecture, <a href="http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/techpaper/vmware-v2d-foundationRA.pdf" target="_blank">Data Center Foundation</a>, serves as the foundation for the SDDC, all SDDC architectures build off of the foundation architecture.<br /><br />The second reference architecture, the <a href="http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/techpaper/vmware-v2d-singleregionRA.pdf" target="_blank">Single-Region IT Automation Cloud</a>, focuses on enabling IT to rapidly respond to business requirements through automating the SDDC. In addition to the reference architecture there is an accompanying deployment walkthrough for <a href="https://featurewalkthrough.vmware.com/#" target="_blank">foundation and single-region IT automation</a> detailing how to build out the reference architecture.<br /><br />We have also launched an early access community under My VMware where you can get access to new documents, provide direct feedback and help influence future designs.<br /><br />Get started by downloading the Data Center Foundation and Single-Region IT Automation Cloud reference architecture white papers and taking time to step through the deployment walkthroughs. We think you‚Äôre really going to like the simplified approach to the SDDC the VMware Validated Designs bring.<br /><br />&lt;hr /&gt;<br /><br />&lt;h4&gt;Other News from VMworld 2015&lt;/h4&gt;<br /><strong>Project Capstone Shows Monster VM Performance </strong>- Project Capstone was put together a few weeks before VMworld 2015 with the goal of being able to show what is possible with Monster VMs today. VMware worked with HP and IBM to put together an impressive setup using vSphere 6.0, HP Superdome X and an IBM FlashSystem array that was able to support running four 120 vCPU VMs simultaneously. Putting these massive Virtual Machines under load we found that performance was excellent with great scalability and a high amount of throughput achieved.<br /><br />vSphere 6 was launched earlier this year and includes support for virtual machines with up to 128 virtual CPUs which is a big increase from the 64 vCPUs supported in vSphere 5.5. ‚ÄúMonster‚Äù virtual machines have a new upper limit and it allows for customers to virtualize even the largest of systems with very hungry CPU needs.<br /><br />The HP Superdome X used for the testing is an impressive system. It has 16 Intel Xeon E7-2890v2 2.8 GHz processors. Each processor has 15 cores and 30 logical threads when Hyper Threading is enabled. In total this is 240 cores / 480 threads.<br /><br />An IBM FlashSystem array with 20TB of superfast low latency storage was used for the project Capstone configuration. It provided extremely low latency throughout all testing and provided such great performance that storage was never a concern or issue. The FlashSystem was extremely easy to setup and use. Within 24 hours of it arriving in the lab, we were actively running four 120 vCPU VMs with sub millisecond latency.<br /><br />Large Oracle 12c database virtual machines running on Redhat Enterprise Linux 6.5 were created and configured with 256GB of RAM, pvSCSI virtual disk adapters, and vmxnet3 virtual NICs. The number of VMs and the number of vCPUs for each VM was varied across the tests.<br /><br />The workload used for the testing was DVD Store 3 (github.com/dvdstore/ds3). DVD Store simulates a real online store with customers logging onto the site, browsing products and product reviews, rating products, and ultimately purchasing those products. The benchmark is measured in Orders Per Minute, with each order representing a complete login, browsing, and purchasing process that includes many individual SQL operations against the database.<br /><br />This large system with 240 cores / 480 threads, an extremely fast and large storage system, and vSphere 6 showed that even with many monster VMs excellent performance and scalability is possible. Each configuration was first stressed by increasing the DVD Store workload until maximum throughput was achieved for a single virtual machine. In all cases this was found to be at near CPU saturation. The number of VM was then increased so that the entire system was fully committed. A whitepaper to be published soon will have the full set of test results, but here we show the results for four 120 vCPU VMs and sixteen 30 vCPU VMs:<br /><br /><a href="https://thatvirtualboy.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/capture.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-484" src="https://thatvirtualboy.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/capture.png?w=300" alt="Capture" width="300" height="182" /></a><br /><br />In both cases the performance of the system when fully loaded with either 4 or 16 virtual machines achieves about 90% of perfect linear scalability when compared to the performance of a single virtual machine.<br /><br />In order to be able to drive the CPU usage to such high levels all disk IO must be very fast so that the system is not waiting for a response. The IBM FlashSystem provided .3 ms average disk latency across all tests. Total disk IO was minimized for these tests to maximize CPU usage and throughput by configuring the database cache size to be equal to the database size. Total disk IO per second (IOPS) peaked at about 50k and averaged 20k while maintaining the extremely low latency during tests.<br /><br />These test results show that it is possible to use vSphere 6 to successfully virtualize even the largest systems with excellent performance.<br /><br /><strong>New VMware NSX SDN OEM, Nvidia Virtual Graphics Partnership </strong>- Hewlett-Packard took another step to deepen its 15-year relationship with VMware today at VMworld 2015 in San Francisco.<br /><br />HP announced a plan to extend its software-defined networking capabilities through a new OEM and reseller agreement with VMware. Since HP now has the ability to sell VMware, this move could allow customers to deploy applications faster, simplify their data center network fabric and improve security.<br /><br />HP plans to federate VMware‚Äôs NSX software-defined networking, or SDN, technology with HP‚Äôs FlexFabric networking technology to assist customers as they gradually migrate toward software-defined data centers.<br /><br />The HP FlexFabric 5930 direct certification with VMware NSX and SDN federated certification will be available in the fourth quarter of this year.<br /><br />HP also shared details about its partnership with Nvidia to combine the VMware Horizon (v6.1) virtual desktop solution, the Nvidia Grid technology for graphics-accelerated virtual desktop and HP‚Äôs OneView management software to give customers the ability to virtualize graphics processing in virtual desktop environments. This will also be available in the fourth quarter of 2015. Nvidia had earlier announced the launch of Grid 2.0, its latest offering in virtual desktop technology.<br /><br />These end-user computing services can support up to 3,500 users and are tested to run desktop-virtualization applications at optimal performance, helping customers reduce provisioning time, cost, setup and installation errors, according to HP.<br /><br />During this week‚Äôs VMworld conference, HP also introduced the Converged Architecture 700, which is a new program that provides reference architecture for enterprise-class workloads, including Microsoft Exchange, Lync, SharePoint and SQL, along with HP‚Äôs Helion cloud and both Citrix and VMware virtual desktop infrastructure offerings.<br /><br />These new products and services are the latest in a series of recent innovations optimized for VMware vSphere, including new hyper-converged and all-flash storage systems, which were announced earlier this month.<br /><br /><strong>VMware Selects Nexenta Open Software-Defined Storage Platform for VMware Virtual SAN File Services </strong>‚Äì Nexenta, in partnership with VMware, today announced that any validated VMware Virtual SAN customer could receive an exclusive promotion of NexentaConnect to achieve file services. <a href="https://nexenta.com/products/nexentaconnect/nexentaconnect-vsan" target="_blank">NexentaConnect for VMware Virtual SAN</a> provides file services for VMware Virtual SAN environments by adding NFS and SMB access on top of an existing Virtual SAN to complete the software hyper-convergence model.<br /><br />Additionally during VMworld 2015 (link is external), Nexenta will showcase this combined solution within VMware‚Äôs Hands-on Lab (HOL).
