I"H<p>Is your app review “taking longer than expected?” Here’s what my experience was like!</p>

<p>On April 2nd 2021, I received a surprising message from the App Review team regarding a build that was submitted to the App Store. The message stated,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The review of your app is taking longer than expected. Once we have completed our review, we will notify you via Resolution Center.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve been submitting apps to the App Store for about a year and never came across this message before. Coupled with the message, my app submission actually showed as “Rejected.” Confusing, no doubt. As tempting as it was to click that “Contact Us” link suggested in the message, I figured I’d wait a bit and see what came of it.</p>

<h3 id="what-could-have-caused-this">What could have caused this</h3>
<p>At the time, I was uploading builds for TestFlight and every once in a while I’d also submit for App Store review to ensure new features were approved. Admittedly, there were some differences around this particular build that could have triggered this message.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>While working on this build, I was in rapid-fire mode which unfortunately led me to submitting several builds up to Review that contained some bugs, which I quickly identified. So I “developer-rejected” the build, and uploaded another one. I did this probably 3 times in a relatively short amount of time. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/"> Docs</a> strongly suggest ensuring builds are fully tested and “ready to be published.” It’s possible that the sequence of several uploads and developer-rejected actions triggered this extended review.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another possibility could be the fact that this build included support for 5 additional languages. Localization is relatively easy to implement in SwiftUI apps, so I was excited to get this added. As far as I can tell, Apple doesn’t specify if adding languages can extend review time, but it’s a possibility.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>One week goes by, and it’s now April 9th. By this point I’m a tad frustrated that I haven’t heard anything. So I go click the “Contact Us” link from before and send a very polite request for a status update. As much as I wanted to complain and make my case, I knew I’m still at Apple’s mercy here so kindness is certainly the correct path!</p>

<p>On April 11th, two days after submitting my inquiry I get a message back from the App Store Review team stating,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I understand your concern regarding the extended review time of your app. However, we still need additional time for review.
No action has been taken against your app at this time, and we have escalated your request to the appropriate internal team. After we complete your app’s review, we will notify you via Resolution Center of any next steps.
We appreciate your continued patience.”</p>
