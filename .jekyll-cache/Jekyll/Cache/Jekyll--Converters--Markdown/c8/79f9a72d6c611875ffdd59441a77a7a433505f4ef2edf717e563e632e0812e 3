I"t<p>I am so excited to finally be writing this post highlighting the new Ubuntu OVA Fling. After <a href="https://thatvirtualboy.com/2020/03/02/the-new-horizon-ubuntu-ova.html">announcing</a> version 1.2 earlier this month, I could barely wait to get the bits and documentation available to the community. Iâ€™m happy to announce version 1.2 is now publicly available!</p>
