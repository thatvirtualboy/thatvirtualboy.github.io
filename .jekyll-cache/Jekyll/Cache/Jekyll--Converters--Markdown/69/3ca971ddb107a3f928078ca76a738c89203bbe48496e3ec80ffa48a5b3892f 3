I"><p>Recently I posted <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/services-education-insights/2016/09/using-ipad-kiosk-mode-horizon-view.html" target="_blank">an article</a> over at VMware’s TAM Blog about working around Kiosk Mode for an iPad using Horizon. Given there is no official Kiosk Mode for iPads, we work around this using a pre-determined username and password that all kiosk users would use. The iPad is then put into <em>Guided Access</em><em> </em>mode to lock the iPad to the Horizon Client app. This configuration is likely best suited for use of a <em>known</em> set of users where individual profiles/accounts aren’t necessary.<br /><br />Head over to the <a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/tam" target="_blank">VMware TAM blog</a> to check it out and other great posts from the Technical Account Manager program!</p>
