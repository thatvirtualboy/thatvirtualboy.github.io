I"¥<p>Iâ€™m thrilled to announce a major update coming soon to Artbox: version 2.7 - Crafting Memories.</p>

<p>Artbox is the stand-out solution for documenting arts and crafts. Whether youâ€™re an artist wanting to document your sketches and paintings, a creator needing to capture your knitting and crocheting creations, or a parent who has creative kids at home, Artbox is the quintessential app for crafting memories.</p>

<p>This update includes over 40 new features, improvements, and fixes making this update the best one to date. Here are just a few worth calling out:</p>

<h4 id="redesigned-project-view">Redesigned Project View</h4>
<p>In this new project view, users can swipe through multiple photos, turn off the background, and double-tap to add the project to favorites.<br />

<h4 id="color-matched-widgets-pro">Color-matched widgets (Pro)</h4>
<p>Widgets come with your free download of Artbox, however one nifty feature thatâ€™s reserved for <em>Pro</em> users is having the widgets automatically be color-matched to the artistâ€™s profile.<br />

<h4 id="four-all-new-exclusive-icons-pro">Four all-new exclusive icons (Pro)</h4>
<p>Iâ€™m excited to add these fun new icons for <em>Pro</em> users. My goal is to add new icons regularly!<br />

<h4 id="other-callouts">Other callouts</h4>
<p><strong>Birthday Settings can now be turned on/off for individual profiles</strong><br />
When Birthday Settings are enabled, artist profiles will display the artistâ€™s age. Even better, when viewing a project the artistâ€™s age <em>at the tie the project was added</em> will be calculated and displayed in the details.</p>

<p>Previously this was a global setting where enabling or disabling the feature would impact every profile. However now with version 2.7, this feature can be turned on and off per profile.</p>

<p><strong>Photo export for Mac</strong><br />
Mac Catalyst users can now export images from individual projects. When an image is saved, it creates an album in your Photos app called â€˜Artboxâ€™ and saves the images there.</p>

<p><strong>Localization updates</strong><br />
Artboxâ€™s primary supported language is English, with support for Chinese (Simplified), Dutch, French, German, and Spanish. Iâ€™m by no means <em>quintilingual</em> and rely on translation services to add this support.</p>

<p>I must admit the last few updates to Artbox didnâ€™t have a lot of focus on localization and translations got further out of date. With this release, they should be much better (though certainly not perfect!)</p>

<p><strong>Loads of stability fixes</strong><br />
This release includes a lot of refinements that improve the overall stability. Most bugs that were fixed were related to how Artbox handles missing data where it expected there to be data.</p>

<h2 id="artbox-pro">Artbox Pro</h2>
<p>Perhaps the biggest change is that Artbox will now be a <strong>free</strong> app for basic usage, with premium features available with a subscription, or one-time payment.</p>

<p><em>Artbox Pro</em> offers the best user experience and is available in 3 flavors:</p>

<ol>
  <li>$0.99 / month</li>
  <li>$9.99 / year</li>
  <li>One-time payment of $24.99 for a Lifetime Subscription</li>
</ol>

<p>I spent a lot of time thinking about the appâ€™s features - what should be included in basic usage and what should be considered <em>Premium</em>. Hereâ€™s the feature comparison chart:</p>

<h2 id="why-change-the-pricing-model">Why change the pricing model</h2>
<p>Developing and publishing Artbox has been one of the most fun and rewarding hobbies Iâ€™ve pursued. Itâ€™s also been the most challenging. In most cases, developing a quality app isnâ€™t just something you work on for a while, then publish to an app store and then youâ€™re done. In fact thatâ€™s when the real work begins in supporting users, marketing, and adding improvements / new features.</p>

<p>The new pricing model is designed to allow ongoing maintenance and support of the app. If Iâ€™ve learned one thing about app development, itâ€™s that it never stops! Artbox has become an essential tool in my family, and I hope it is for my users as well.</p>

<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h2>
<p>Version 2.7 is undergoing a phased rollout and should be available to everyone by March 28th. Thanks for making it this far into the post!
