I"%<p>Earlier this year I bought a Zmodo Greet Pro Smart Doorbell. It was cheap, didnâ€™t require a monthly subscription, and had relatively decent reviews. It was a breeze to install, and had it up and running the day it arrived. Fast forward about 1.5 months, and something weird happened.</p>
